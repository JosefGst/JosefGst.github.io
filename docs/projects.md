# :heart: Projects
A collection of my side projects. Reaching 100% completion is almost impossible for me. But partially finished is good enough for this :memo: list.

I was lucky enough to find a functional computer power supply in the electric waste of the Uni campus. There are many good tutorials on YouTube how to convert it into a bench power supply. Links to the tutorials are below. It proved to be a very useful tool for charging batteries and powering prototypes. The front panel is 3D printed and I used Fusion360 for the design.
