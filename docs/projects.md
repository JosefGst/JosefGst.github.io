# :heart: Projects

A collection of my side projects. Reaching 100% completion is almost impossible for me. But partially finished is good enough for this :memo: list.

A wannabe beach cleaning Robot. The goal is to use the coverage planner to drive up a specified area and filter big particles out of the sand, like a vacuum cleaning robot but on the beach.

## :electric_plug: Power Supply

I was lucky enough to find a functional computer power supply in the electric waste of the Uni campus. There are many good tutorials on YouTube how to convert it into a bench power supply. Links to the tutorials are below. It proved to be a very useful tool for charging batteries and powering prototypes. The front panel is 3D printed and I used Fusion360 for the design.

## :red_car: [Autonomous RC-car race (first place)](https://github.com/JosefGst/autorace) :trophy:

March 2021

[![rc-car race](gifs/rc_car.gif)](https://github.com/JosefGst/autorace)


Let's train the Jetson-racer to drive autonomously, avoid obstacles and overtake other cars. Basically you drive along the race course and record images with the corresponding throttle and steering values. This data we fed into the a ML model and let it train. It was much fun and I resliced what machine learning is capable of but also it's limitations.
