Basically I drove along the race course and recorded images with the corresponding throttle and steering values. This data is fed into the a ML model and let it train. It was much fun and I resliced what machine learning is capable of but also it's limitations. </p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": []}]}
